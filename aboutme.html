            I'm a passionate and versatile Virtual Assistant with a knack for
            organization and a flair for web development. With a strong
            foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combined with my experience
            in managing executive schedules and handling complex administrative
            tasks, I bring a unique blend of technical and administrative skills
            to the table.

      <h3>My journey</h3>
      <p>
        My career path has been anything but ordinary. After earning my ESL
        certificate and spending nearly three years as an English tutor at
        Engoo, I discovered my love for helping others and creating efficient,
        productive environments. This passion led me to pursue intensive Virtual
        Assistant training with ALX, where I honed my skills in calendar
        management, trip planning, data entry, email management, and Google
        Workspace.
      </p>
      <h3>What drives me</h3>
      <p>
        I thrive on helping busy professionals stay organized and focused on
        what they do best. Whether itâ€™s coordinating a hectic schedule, planning
        a detailed itinerary, or ensuring that emails are promptly managed, I
        take pride in making life easier for my clients. My goal is to provide
        top-notch support, allowing my clients to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <h3>Beyond the screen</h3>
      <p>
        When I'm not working I'm coding. I love creating and exploring the world
        of Web development. Over the months I have improved my skills.
      </p>
      <h3>Lets Connect</h3>
      <p>
        I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you think
        we would make a great team or you just want to talk about the latest Web
        Development trends, feel free to reach out.
